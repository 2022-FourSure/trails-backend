        "description":"This trail features many trails around Horsetooth Mountain and provides beautiful scenic views of Colorado. The top of Horsetooth Mountain provides views of Pikes Peak, the Rocky Mountains, and others in the distance. The trail was certainly manageable and guided. There is a consistently steady incline covering about 2,000 feet of incline. Most of the trails are narrow, but still accessible for bikes and dogs. There are some loose rocks (big and small) and tree roots along the trails, but none are overly difficult to overcome. The most difficult aspects of this combination of trails are the inclines and the length of the hike. The first half of the loop climbs steadily, with a short side trip to Horsetooth Falls at about one mile. From there, you'll continue a steady climb on Spring Creek Trail. Eventually, after a short connecting section on Towers, turn onto West Ridge Trail to wind back to the south. This trail will connect you to the Horsetooth Rock Trail which takes you up to the summit. Enjoy the views before starting you descent back to the trailhead on the South Ridge Trail.",

The most difficult aspects of this combination of trails are the inclines and the length of the hike. /nThe first half of the loop climbs steadily, with a short side trip to Horsetooth Falls at about one mile. From there, you'll continue a steady climb on Spring Creek Trail. Eventually, after a short connecting section on Towers, turn onto West Ridge Trail to wind back to the south. This trail will connect you to the Horsetooth Rock Trail which takes you up to the summit. Enjoy the views before starting you descent back to the trailhead on the South Ridge Trail.",
